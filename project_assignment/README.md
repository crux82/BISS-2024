# BISS 2024 - Course on Large Language Models
## Project Assignment

### Author: Danilo Croce - University of Rome, Tor Vergata

## Objective

The aim of this project is to fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) on a sentence inference task of your choice (e.g., text classification,  regression or any other task as shown in the course, from [EVALITA](https://www.evalita.it/campaigns/evalita-2023/tasks/)). Participants may use an Encoder-based architecture or a Decoder-only architecture, leveraging the examples provided during the course.

- Participants can select one or multiple sentence inteference tasks. If multiple tasks are selected, a multi-task approach is recommended.
- An example of Encoder-only architecture: [BISS-2024 LAB-2.1](https://github.com/crux82/BISS-2024/blob/main/BISS-2024_LAB-1_Training_BERT_based_models_in_few_lines_of_code.ipynb).
- An example of Decoder-only architecture: [BISS-2024 LAB-2.2](https://github.com/crux82/BISS-2024/blob/main/BISS-2024_LAB-2.2_ExtremITA_train.ipynb) and [BISS-2024 LAB-2.3](https://github.com/crux82/BISS-2024/blob/main/BISS-2024_LAB-2.3_ExtremITA_inference.ipynb).
- More resources can be in general found at the [BISS 2024 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/crux82/BISS-2024).

## Project Group Composition

The project may be completed in groups, with a maximum of 5 participants per group.

For groups consisting of 4 or 5 participants, it is *mandatory* to either tackle at least two different tasks *or* conduct a comparative study between Encoder-only and Decoder-only architectures on the same task.

## Report

**Each group is required to produce an experimental report** (short paper) that adheres to the following guidelines:

- **Length**: Your report should not exceed 4 pages, adhering to the [ACL format guidelines](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files). Groups of 4 or 5 participants are allowed one additional page, making a total of 5 pages. Please note that references are not included in the page count.
- **Content**:
  - **Description of the Task**: Outline the task(s) you have chosen.
  - **Dataset Description**: Detail the dataset(s) utilized in your project.
  - **Architecture Overview**: Provide a minimal description of the neural architecture employed.
  - **Experimental Setup**: Describe the experimental setup, including any preprocessing, the model's configuration, and the training process.
  - **Results and Analysis**: Present the outcomes of your experiments and provide a detailed analysis of these results. To enhance the depth of your analysis, it is recommended to include comparisons with other methods documented in the literature. This comparative analysis should serve as a benchmark, helping to contextualize your project's performance within the broader field of study.
  - **(Optional) Error Analysis**: While not mandatory, an error analysis of the model's performance on your data is welcome.


## Submission Process

To submit your project, please follow these steps:

- Compile a list of all group members, including their full names.
- Attach the experimental report as specified in the project guidelines.
- Optionally, include your code or a link to an external repository where your code can be accessed.

Email all of the above to: [croce@info.uniroma2.it](mailto:croce@info.uniroma2.it)

The deadline for project submission is **May 31, 2024** (sharp). 

Please ensure that your email subject line is formatted as ``[BISS 2024 LLM Project]`, to facilitate the sorting and review process.

## Evaluation Criteria
Projects will be evaluated based on the clarity and comprehensiveness of the report, the creativity and relevance of the selected task, the rigor of the experimental setup, and the depth of the analysis and insights provided. Special attention will be given to reports that demonstrate a thoughtful error analysis and propose potential improvements.
